# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
To address real world issues, computer scientists create software and algorithms. This work is important because it boosts efficiency, encourages innovation across industries, and resolves problems that are impossible for humans to handle on their own. As a tiny illustration of how artificial intelligence may automate decision making and enhance results, I used reinforcement learning principles in this project to develop an intelligent agent that adjusts to its surroundings.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I divide issues into manageable chunks, do careful analysis, and apply fixes regularly. I determined the elements of Q-learning states, actions, rewards, and experience replay and meticulously put each one into practice for this project. Testing and debugging were essential to making sure the solution functioned as planned.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
One of my ethical obligations is to make sure the solutions I provide are transparent, dependable, and equitable. Even though reinforcement learning maximizes results, biases in the data must be avoided, and the system must act reliably. I also have to protect user privacy, make sure data is secure, and strike a balance between automation and moral principles like preventing injury or job displacement.
